# Double-slit-experiment

# Objective
  Obtain diffraction patterns for the single and double slit experiment using relevant equations. Use 
  following parameters for simulations. Assume that the intensity at the central maximum (center of 
  the diffraction pattern) is a unity. i.e. Intensities are normalized.
  
 Was performed in 2 parts.
 
     Part A: For the single slit
          Slit width = 12 𝜇𝑚
          Wavelength of the light ray = 480 𝑛𝑚
          Distance from the slit to the screen = 3 𝑚
          Angle to the furthest away point from the central maximum = 𝜋/8
      
    Part B: For the double slit
          Slit width = 30 𝜇𝑚
          Distance between two slits = 0.15 𝑚𝑚
          Wavelength = 480 𝑛𝑚
          Distance from the slit to the screen = 3 𝑚
          Angle to the furthest away point from the central maximum = 𝜋/50
